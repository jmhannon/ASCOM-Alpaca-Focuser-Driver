This is an ASCOM Alpaca focuser driver. This driver uses the Moonlite focuser protocol. It was written to control
custom focuser. The driver has not been tested with an actual Moonlite focuser as I don't have one.
The driver was developed using the AlpycaDevice SDK 0.5.0

This is a preliminary release and may not function properly.
